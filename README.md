````

* Create and activate virtual environment.

```
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

* Install dependencies.

```
$ pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Variables

Properly setup the environment variables or populate `config.py` with the values. Setting up environment variables is advised as some of the values are sensitive data, and should be kept secret.

* `API_ID`(required) - Get your telegram API_ID from [https://my.telegram.org/](https://my.telegram.org/).
* `API_HASH`(required) - Get your telegram API_HASH from [https://my.telegram.org/](https://my.telegram.org/).
* `BOT_TOKEN`(required) - Obtain your bot token from [Bot Father](https://t.me/BotFather "Bot Father").
* `LOG_CHANNEL`(required) - Log channel's id.
* `DATABASE_URL`(required) - Mongodb database URI.
* `AUTH_USERS`(required) - Admin(s) of the bot. User's telegram id separated by space. Atleast one id should be specified.
* `HOST`(required) - Public URL of file streaming service ([See Setting up Streaming Service](#setting-up-streaming-service)).
* `SESSION_NAME`(optional) - Name you want to call your bot's session, Eg: bot's username.
* `MAX_PROCESSES_PER_USER`(optional) - Number of parallel processes each user can have, defaults to 2.
* `MAX_TRIM_DURATION`(optional) - Maximum allowed video trim duration in seconds. Defaults to 600s.
* `TRACK_CHANNEL`(optional) - User activity tracking channel's id. Only needed if you want to track and block any user. Disabled by default.
* `SLOW_SPEED_DELAY`(optional) - Delay required between each interaction from users in seconds. Defaults to 5s.

* `WORKER_COUNT` (optional) - Number of process to be handled at a time. Defaults to `20`.

### Run bot

`$ python3 -m bot`

Now go and `/start` the bot. If everything went right, bot will respond with welcome message.

## Setting up Streaming Service

The streaming service can be a custom version of [TgFileStream](https://github.com/tulir/tgfilestream), modded to work with this setup. The mod basicaly is adding a type of header based authentication and changing the endpoints. The authentication part is optional and the endpoint used here is `/file/:chat_id/:message_id`. Make sure to note these changes when deploying your own instance. The streaming service used for [@screenshotit_bot](https://tx.me/screenshotit_bot "Screenshot Generator Bot") is not related to [TgFileStream](https://github.com/tulir/tgfilestream) and I do not plan to make it OSS.
